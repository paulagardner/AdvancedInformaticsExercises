 Editing README in VSC code editor.
 Will then make a pull request adding this to website.
 Notes/Text: Confused myself trying to figure out how to add text in the README such that I would have a new branch to make pull requests from.
 Made a new directory, a README.md within it, and thought I would add the two. Didn't follow through but realized I should just be able to edit the README by pushing changes from a new branch but working on the same file.
 Issue was conflating directories and branches. Now it makes more sense- you can work on files located wherever, even on "main", but not actually be pushing to main.
